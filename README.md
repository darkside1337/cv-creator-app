Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://main--inquisitive-yeot-d9683d.netlify.app/).

## Features

1. **useState Hook:** Utilized the `useState` hook to manage and update the state of the application components.

2. **useImmer for Complex Objects:** For more complex state management, the `useImmer` library was incorporated to simplify the handling of mutable objects.

3. **User Input Handling:** Implemented user input handling to gather information such as personal details, education, work experience, and skills.

4. **Interactivity:** Created interactive components like forms where users can input their data and see the changes in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

- [useImmer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer) for handling complex state updates
